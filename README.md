# Assignment-2: Data Structures in Python

## Description
You are required to implement basic data structures from scratch using Python.

**Note**: Do not use built-in libraries like `collections` or `queue` for core logic. All implementations must be written manually.

## Data Structures to Implement

### Stack (LIFO)
- `push(item)` → Add an element to the stack
- `pop()` → Remove and return the top element
- `peek()` → Return the top element without removing it
- `is_empty()` → Check if stack is empty
- `size()` → Return number of elements

### Queue (FIFO)
- `enqueue(item)` → Add an element to the queue
- `dequeue()` → Remove and return the first element
- `peek()` → Return the first element without removing it
- `is_empty()` → Check if queue is empty
- `size()` → Return number of elements

### Singly Linked List
- `append(data)` → Add a node at the end
- `prepend(data)` → Add a node at the beginning
- `delete(data)` → Delete a node with given value
- `display()` → Print the linked list

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- `insert(value)` → Insert a node
- `search(value)` → Check if value exists
- `inorder()` → In-order traversal (sorted output)
- `preorder()` → Pre-order traversal
- `postorder()` → Post-order traversal

### HashMap (Dictionary)
- `put(key, value)` → Add or update a key-value pair
- `get(key)` → Retrieve value by key
- `remove(key)` → Delete a key-value pair

**Collision Handling**: Use **chaining** (list of lists) for handling hash collisions.
